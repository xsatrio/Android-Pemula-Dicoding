She is frequently seen wearing a jersey and spends most of her time at home playing the guitar in a dark closet, hardly ever venturing out. Whenever a situation arises, she tries to hide in a trash can, cardboard box, or other objects, even performing her first live house show from inside a cardboard box. Despite her attempts to liven things up, she usually fails, either by slipping up or overdoing it. She craves approval from others, likely as a reaction to her personality.

Although she didn\'t know that Bocchi was "guitarhero", she was quick to realize her talent as a guitarist. She can be quite of a tsundere at times, especially when it comes to her little sister Nijika. For example, Nijika claimed that Seika opened Starry for her, even though Seika will never admit that.
